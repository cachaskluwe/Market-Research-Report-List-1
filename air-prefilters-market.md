<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Prefilters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Grid or Screen</li><li>Spongy Looking</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Air prefilters are essential components in filtration systems, designed to capture larger particles before they reach the main filter. There are two primary types: grid or screen prefilters, which use a mesh structure to block debris while allowing airflow; and spongy-looking prefilters, characterized by their porous foam material that traps dust and allergens effectively. Grid prefilters are typically more durable and easy to clean, while spongy prefilters offer enhanced particulate retention and are often disposable, catering to different filtration needs.</p></p>
